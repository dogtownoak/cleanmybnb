Project case study:

FACTS AT A GLANCE

Project Name:  CleanMyBnb
The Problem:  Airbnb units need to be cleaned at guest checkout
Client/Geography: USA
Industry: Hotel, Cleaning, Property Management Industries
Users:  Airbnb Hosts and Cleaners
Challenges: Hosts need to spend time finding and scheduling cleaners at a reasonable price.  If this isn’t accomplished, they must clean themselves or not clean. 
Risks & Assumptions:
Solution: An app that allows Hosts and cleaners to Sign up/ Sign in. Both would be able to view a calendar for check-ins/checkouts. Hosts can setup an automatic cleaning system
Results: The MVP was successfully created.
Technologies: MongoDB, Express, Node.js, Semantic UI, FullCalendar

Overview:

CleanMyBnb matches Airbnb hosts with cleaners.  Holding several rental units, I sought an effortless platform to secure cleaners for Airbnb units with each guest’s departure.  I developed a process providing hosts the automated ability to secure cleaners efficiently and effectively.   Hosts are able to find reasonably priced cleaners without the tedious scheduling work.  Cleaners fill their schedules with a large pipeline of back to back appointments.

Context & Challenge

Background & Description

I completed this proof of concept myself and intend to have a beta version ready to go live in Q2 2019.  Our first test will be with 10-20 local Airbnb hosts and cleaners.

Problem

Airbnb units need to be cleaned at guest checkout.  Hosts often can’t find a cleaner. This means they end up cleaning the unit.  When they can find a cleaner the fee is often too expensive because it’s a “one time appointment” for the cleaner. 

Cleaners have to spend time and money marketing/finding  business.  If they work for a service they don’t have to spend time finding business but they are not getting paid for the full value of their work.

Goals & Objectives
The goal is to have cleaners set their own appointments.

The minimum viable product (MVP): An app that allows Hosts and cleaners to Sign up/ Sign in. Both would be able to view a calendar for check-ins/checkouts. Hosts can setup an automatic cleaning system with a preferred cleaner or notify all cleaners to bid.


Process & Insight

I created the initial mockups and ERD’s after conducting market and user research.  Two hosts were contacted and interviewed to discuss their product “wish list” and checkout “pain points.”  I received some interesting feedback while doing this research and creating the user stories.  Host did not like the bidding system.  They felt cleaners would bid up prices and render the product useless.  The bidding portion was eliminated from the MVP and final product.
Hosts need help, but is there a market for it?

Airbnb Case Study:
600,000 rental units in US *	
Assumptions: 
•	Occupancy: 18 days/month with an average duration of 3 nights**
•	6 Checkouts = 6 cleanings per Month**
•	$5 booking fee

43,200,000: Airbnb Cleanings Per Year
•	Capturing Just 1% of the Market: 432,000 Cleanings
•	Translates into: Annual Revenue of: $2,160,000

Solution

Hosts and cleaners can login on the home page.  Upon login both user types are taken to the home page.  Host can create Airbnb housing units and cleaning events.  Hosts can view all housing units and cleaning events in their profile and unassign cleaners.  Cleaner can assign and unassign themselves to cleaning events.  Both users can navigate to a calendar where they can view all guest checkouts and cleaning events.  Here cleaners can also assign and unassign themselves to cleaning events.

Result

	The MVP was successfully created.
